## The problem
What you wanted and why it mattered.

## Constraints
Budget, time, hardware, power, reliability.

## Design
Architecture + tradeoffs (why this approach, why not alternatives).

## Implementation
Provisioning, tooling, monitoring, what you built yourself.

## Results
Benchmarks, screenshots, costs, lessons.

## What I’d improve
What you’d change next iteration.
